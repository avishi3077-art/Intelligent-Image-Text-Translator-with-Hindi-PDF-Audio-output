Intelligent-Image-Text-Translator-with-Hindi-PDF-Audio-output
This project integrates OCR, machine translation, and text-to-speech technologies to build a complete image-to-Hindi conversion system. When the user uploads an image, the system automatically detects and extracts the text using OCR. The extracted English text is then processed and translated into accurate Hindi. The output is presented in two formats: a downloadable PDF document and a Hindi audio file generated using text-to-speech. This project is useful for students, teachers, professionals, and anyone who needs quick translation of printed content into Hindi with both readable and audible formats.
